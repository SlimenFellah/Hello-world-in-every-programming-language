# Hello-world-in-every-programming-language
As the title idicates in this repository i will try to write simple programs in every programming language ever existed. including query and markup languages and assembly.
This is a project where i am managing to get in touch with every programming language.
As a start i did print the hello world for all pl that i currently know. and i will try to improve those programs in order to do more than a simple print.
If you have any programming language to suggest feel free to reach me in discord @soulayman31
If you liked the idea don't forget to star this repository.
Thank you.
